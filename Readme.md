This project focuses on the development of a maze-solving and sorting-based puzzle game, The Zombie Escape, to demonstrate the application of algorithmic concepts and interactive gameplay mechanics. The Zombie Escape is a two-level game that challenges players with a procedurally generated maze and an algorithm-based sorting task, combining problem-solving skills with real-time interaction.
This project will involve implementing a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to generate a unique maze in Level 1, where players must navigate and find the exit using arrow key controls. The second level introduces an array sorting challenge, where a randomly generated array must be sorted using different algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Shell Sort, Heap Sort, and Quick Sort. Each game session presents a different sorting method, reinforcing the understanding of sorting techniques.
The project aims to create an engaging and educational game that demonstrates the practical applications of graph traversal algorithms and sorting algorithms in an interactive environment. By combining logical thinking with hands-on gameplay, The Zombie Escape offers both an entertaining experience and a valuable learning tool for algorithm enthusiasts.
